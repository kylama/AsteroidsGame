# Asteroids

This web application replicates the old video game Asteroids using object-oriented programming. The Star class is created for the background, and the Floater class is created to represent all things that float in space. The Asteroid, Bullet, and Spaceship classes are subclasses for the Floater class, and the SmallAsteroid class is a subclass of the Asteroid class.
